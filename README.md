# Unlockify

Unlocks everything without affecting achievements, anything locked before installing will remain locked after uninstalling or disabling the mod.

If you want to affect achievements or have the unlocks persist without the mod being installed, use [RealerCheatUnlocks](https://thunderstore.io/package/prodzpod/RealerCheatUnlocks/) instead.

`Note:` Survivor logbook entries might not unlock, at least modded survivors specifically.

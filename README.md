# DON'T INSTALL THIS
## I don't know what I'm doing

I can barely code, and definitely not in C#, so this is a scuffed abomination. If you want to unlock things without affecting achievements, please go to the original [Unlockify Mod](https://thunderstore.io/package/Nuxlar/Unlockify/).
-# like why are you here
Otherwise if you want to obliterate achievements go to [RealerCheatUnlocks](https://thunderstore.io/package/prodzpod/RealerCheatUnlocks/) or use SAM if that works.
